Kazmath was originally written for Beginning OpenGL Game Programming II but has been continually improved and updated since then. It's now a fairly large library being used by quite a few people. I've recently moved development of kazmath completely from Launchpad over to GitHub. You can find the repository here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kazade/kazmath"&gt;https://github.com/Kazade/kazmath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazmath is BSD licensed so free to use in both open and closed projects. Feel free to report bugs, and if you improve the library, just send me a pull request on GitHub :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>0 A.D Hits Alpha 9</title><link href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/0_ad_hits_alpha_9/81001/" rel="alternate"></link><id>http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/0_ad_hits_alpha_9/81001/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Open source, and OpenGL powered strategy game 0 A.D has released a new version. Alpha 9 brings a new Roman Republic faction, a new combat system, a new trading system, improved AI and new animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of historical RTS's then you definitely should check this out. 0 A.D is free to download for Linux, Mac and Windows from &lt;a href="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/" target="_blank"&gt;the WildFire Games website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As this might interest quite a lot of you, I just show you what he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The issue is the default in VC10 char* to&amp;nbsp;LPCWSTR conversion. The gamedev forums do mention the issue. This code can be added as one of the many conversions at the bottom of the tutorial page &amp;nbsp;or the solution of changing the properties in Visual Studio could be included in the text. StackOverFlow (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3924926/cannot-convert-parameter-1-from-char-to-lpcwstr" target="_blank"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3924926/cannot-convert-parameter-1-from-char-to-lpcwstr&lt;/a&gt;) has a question about this issue with a nice screen shot of the option to be changed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As the same issue is present across tutorials I would suggest explaining to a Visual Studio user the source of the problem and the Character Set = Not Set option listed above.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thank you for that hint!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So watch out for this specific error whenever you compile one of the legacy tutorials, and I'll add a note about this to the lessons!&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Open Source AMD R600 Driver Supports OpenGL 3.0</title><link href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/the_open_source_amd_r600_driver_supports_opengl_30/66001/" rel="alternate"></link><id>http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/the_open_source_amd_r600_driver_supports_opengl_30/66001/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a follow up to &lt;a href="/news/mesa_80_to_support_opengl_30_/58002/"&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; that Mesa3D (the open-source implementation of the OpenGL API) will begin supporting OpenGL 3.0 and GLSL 1.30 from the next release; &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=MTA1MDM" target="_blank"&gt;Phoronix&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that the open source AMD driver for the R600 series of chipsets can now leverage the new OpenGL 3.0 support in Mesa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-source AMD drivers are remarkably stable, although slower than AMD's official "fglrx" driver. The new OpenGL 3.0 support is an amazing step forward for the open-source driver stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that anyone with an R600 based card (which includes me!) will get full OpenGL 3.0 hardware acceleration out of the box on Linux after the next round of distro releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone is curious to see the source code of the commit that introduces this support, &lt;a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=171be755223d99f8cc5cc1bdaf8bd7b4caa04b4f" target="_blank"&gt;take a look here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Wine Project Prepares Version 1.4</title><link href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/the_wine_project_prepares_version_14/62008/" rel="alternate"></link><id>http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/the_wine_project_prepares_version_14/62008/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_%28software%29" target="_blank"&gt;The Wine project&lt;/a&gt; is a cross-platform reimplementation of the Win32 API that allows Windows applications to run on other operating systems. Over the years it has become more and more stable and runs many popular Direct3D-based games by translating the D3D and older DirectDraw calls to OpenGL. Stable releases of Wine are infrequent, releasing about once every 2 years, but the time for a new stable release is approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- break --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead developer of Wine, Alexandre Julliard has just released Wine 1.4 rc-1 and now the developers will focus on bug fixing rather than new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm personally indebted to the Wine project for providing me a way to run my old Windows games and GOG.com purchases on my OS of choice. It's an epic undertaking and it's amazing what the developers have achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the release announcement for Wine 1.4-rc1 &lt;a href="http://www.winehq.org/announce/1.4-rc1" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>We Now Have a Facebook Page!</title><link href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/we_now_have_a_facebook_page/63007/" rel="alternate"></link><id>http://nehe.gamedev.net/news/we_now_have_a_facebook_page/63007/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just created a Facebook page for NeHe where we'll post status and news updates.

The first iOS lessons of the series are already available with more coming.

You're in for a treat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rasberry Pi is a mini credit-card sized system on a chip that will be launching in the next month or so. It will come in two versions, one at $25 and a more expensive one with extra ram at $35. Amazingly, the GPU built into this cheap little computer is faster than that of an iPhone 4S and also faster than Nvidia's Tegra 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- break --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board has an HDMI output, is powered by any mini-usb charger and is built to be extended. It is also capable of 1080P video playback. It will support several Linux distributions out of the box and also XBMC the famous open source media center software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing? It runs OpenGL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll keep you updated on the progress of the release, but apparently the first boards have been manufactured and will be on sale soon.&lt;/p&gt;
