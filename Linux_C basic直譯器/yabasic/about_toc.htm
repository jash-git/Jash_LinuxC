<h1>About this table of content</h1>
<p>Everyone likes a table of content (toc), which consists of nested menus which 
expand and collapse at the click of a mouse. So do I !</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm not a java script programmer, so I decided to take a free 
java script toc and modify it for my purpose. I tried quite a few, without ever 
finding one, which worked well in frames (yes, this page has frames) and with 
ANY browser.</p>
<p>Moreover my low cost internet provider does not allow for cgi-scripts, so 
I could not generate the pages for a toc with a simple cgi-script. After some 
years (sometimes I'm slow witted) I finally realized that I do not need cgi-scripts 
at all, but could generate the needed pages in advance on my pc and upload them 
all together to my provider !</p>
<p>Its just that simple: If you expand one of the menu-items in the toc (by 
clicking on the +-sign) you really switch to a diffferent page which contains 
this menu-item in expanded state. You can easily verify this by looking at the 
link-destination, which most browser display at the status-line. No magic, no 
javascript, no dhtml just plain old html.</p>
<p>But with 7 expandable menu-items the toc needs 2^7=128 different pages: too 
much to write and keep up to date by hand. To get rid of this boring task I 
wrote a short perl-script; once started it generates the 128 pages which I just 
have to upload to my provider.</p>
<p>Thats the whole story. If you want the perl-script (subject to the same license 
as yabasic), you may donwload it <a href="perl_wrapper.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/perl_wrapper.htm">here</a>.</p>
