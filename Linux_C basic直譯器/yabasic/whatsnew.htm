        <p>
            Yabasic implements the most common and simple elements of the
            basic language; It comes with goto/gosub, with various loops,
            with user defined subroutines and Libraries. Yabasic does
            monochrome line graphics and printing. Yabasic runs under Unix
            and Windows; it is small (around 200KB) and free.
