<h1>The new documentation of yabasic</h1>
<p>Over the years the <a href="yabasic_old.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/yabasic_old.htm">old documentation</a> has outgrown 
its initial design and finally failed to satisfy the needs of beginning and advanced 
programmers alike. Moreover, its html-code  had become quite - 
umm - untidy over the years. Therefore: Both, form and content needed a rewrite.</p>
<p>Well the new documentation (which has become the current documentation by 
now) should be an improvement in both respects. The new docu is written in xml 
 with <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.docbook.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.docbook.org/'" tppabs="http://www.docbook.org/">docbook</a> as a dtd.</p>
<p>The <a href="yabasic.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/yabasic.htm">new documentation</a> is distributed as a html-document, which is generated 
by <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/'" tppabs="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">xsltproc</a> with a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://docbook.sourceforge.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://docbook.sourceforge.net/'" tppabs="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/">html-stylesheet</a> 
from the xml-source <a href="yabwrap.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/yabwrap.htm">yabasic.xml</a>.</p>
<h2>A problem ...</h2>
<p>Docbook can&nbsp;be easily transformed into relly nice <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.yabasic.de/desktop/homepage/yabasic.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.yabasic.de/desktop/homepage/yabasic.htm'" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/desktop/homepage/yabasic.htm">html</a>; 
However I have&nbsp;problems to transform it &nbsp;into <b>nroff</b>, the format 
which is used for Unix <b>man</b>-pages. Of course there are numerous tools 
(e.g. <b>docbook-to-man</b>, <b>sgmltools</b> or <b>sgmltools-lite</b>), which 
claim to&nbsp;do just that; but unfortunately they either produce ill-formatted 
garbage (at least, when I&nbsp;used them) or they only transform the <b>refentry</b>-elements 
of yabasic.xml.</p>
<p>Currently, I have chosen to transform yabasic.xml into pure ascii-text and 
to embed this text <i>as-is</i> within&nbsp;the unix man-page.&nbsp;However, 
the result is weak (although much better than the old documentation).&nbsp;Therefore 
I would really appreciate any hint, on how to transform <i>all of</i> yabasic.xml 
into a <i>single</i> nroff-document; please <a href="mailto:mail@yabasic.de">mail 
me</a>, if you have any suggestions or hints.</p>
