<h1><a name="whatsnew">Support</a></h1>
<p>First of all, have a look at the <a href="yabasic.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/yabasic.htm" target="_self">Manual 
of Yabasic</a>&nbsp;!</p>
<h2>What is in the Manual</h2>
<p>The <a href="yabasic.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/yabasic.htm" target="_self"><b>Manual 
of Yabasic</b></a> describes all the features and properties of yabasic in great 
depth and extent. It is packed with examples and it should contain everything 
to get you up and going with yabasic. </p>
<p>Even if you experience a problem, <b>a second reading</b> should solve it&nbsp;in 
most cases.</p>
<p>However, there are some problems, where the manual might not be enough and&nbsp;you 
may find answers or suggestions in  the new&nbsp;<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://f27.parsimony.net/forum67475/index.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://f27.parsimony.net/forum67475/index.htm'" tppabs="http://f27.parsimony.net/forum67475/index.htm" target="_self"><b>Forum</b></a>

<h2>Why Forum and Wiki for Yabasic ?</h2>

<P>Over time I answered some questions over and over again; however it turned out, 
that I am too lazy to write them up and put them into the FAQ. Therefore a lot 
of information, which might have been useful for all users of yabasic, has been 
sent to just a single person by mail and therby lost for all others who might 
have experienced the same problem.<P>The <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://f27.parsimony.net/forum67475/index.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://f27.parsimony.net/forum67475/index.htm'" tppabs="http://f27.parsimony.net/forum67475/index.htm" target="_self">Forum</a> 
 is intended to record the ongoing discussion about yabasic; however, as new 
messages are added continously, old messages tend to go out of sight, even if 
they contained useful information. The <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://wiki27.parsimony.net/cgi-bin/wiki/program/db-view.cgi?wiki67475;1  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://wiki27.parsimony.net/cgi-bin/wiki/program/db-view.cgi?wiki67475;1'" tppabs="http://wiki27.parsimony.net/cgi-bin/wiki/program/db-view.cgi?wiki67475;1">Wiki</a> 
now should help to keep and collect such information, that has proven to be 
useful for many users of yabasic.
<p>In the past many&nbsp;users of yabasic have shown the ability and will to 
help others along with yabasic; Forum and Wiki give them&nbsp;a platform.</p>

<p>If you have problems <b>compiling</b> yabasic under <b>Unix</b>, you should 
add the file <b>runme.log</b> , which is created by the <b>runme</b>-script 
and contains all the information needed to pin down the error.</p>
<p>If you have <b>trouble</b> with some yabasic-<b>command</b> or <b>program 
</b>, you should create a minimum sample program to reproduce the error; please 
keep this sample program as small as possible. Then take the program and send 
it to  me. Add a short description of you problem, containing: 

<ul>
    <li>Which Operating system are you using: Windows (95, 98, me, xp,  NT, 
    2000) or Unix (linux, 
    solaris, ...) ? 
    <li>How does the program behave on your computer ? What did you expect ? 
    
    <li>Which version of yabasic are you using ? Please try the latest one !</ul>
