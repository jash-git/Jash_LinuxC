<h2>How I built DBD::Oracle under HPUX ...</h2>
<p>Just (march 17, 2000) managed to build DBD::Oracle under HPUX 11.0. If you 
are trying to do the same and have found that it's not a piece of cake, you 
may read on.</p>
<p>Here is my configuration: 
<ul type="square">
    <li>Oracle 8.1.6 
    <li>HP's commercial C-Compiler. Not gcc and not the bundled one 
    <li>HPUX 11.0, 32 Bit 
    <li>Latest version of perl, DBI and DBD 
</ul>
<h3>Rebuilding perl</h3>
<p>Yes, I had to rebuild my perl (a guy from HP support gave me that tip): 
<ul type="square">
    <li>Added the linker switch &quot;+s&quot;, to make the dynamic loader search 
    through the directories in $SHLIB_PATH. Maybe this is not necessary, but 
    it helps when you use the same perl executable on different machines with 
    different directory structures. In this case you just have to make SHLIB_PATH 
    point into $ORACL_HOME/lib and the dynamic loader will be able to find the 
    libraries. 
    <li>Linked with the libraries &quot;-lcl -lpthread&quot;. I first tried 
    without those libraries, but then I got lots of errors during tests of DBD::Oracle 
    from the hpux dynamic loader dld.sl. After linking you may check your perl 
    executable with chatr: &quot;chatr ./perl&quot; the libraries libcl.sl and 
    libpthread.sl should appear in the output. 
</ul>
<p>Afterwards I build DBI without any special settings. DBD::Oracle requires 
again some modifications: 
<ul type="square">
    <li>Added the libraries &quot;-lclntsh -lqsmashr&quot; 
</ul>
