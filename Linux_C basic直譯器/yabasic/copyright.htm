<h1><a name="copyright">Copyright</a></h1>
<p>Yabasic may be copied, at your choice, under the terms of either the <a href="artistic.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/artistic.htm">Artistic 
License</a> or the <a href="gpl.htm" tppabs="http://www.yabasic.de/gpl.htm">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL).</p>
<p>Earlier versions of yabasic have been subject to the GPL alone and it is 
kept for backward compatibility. Since version 2.60 you have the <strong>choice</strong> 
to use yabasic under the terms of the Artistic License, which gives you the 
right to <strong>use and distribute yabasic in a more-or-less customary fashion</strong>, 
plus the right to make reasonable modifications, while giving the original author 
some semblance of <strong>artistic control</strong> over the development of 
yabasic.</p>
<p>Regardless which license you choose (GPL or Artistic) for yabasic, it does 
not apply to your own <strong>yabasic-programs</strong>. The programs you write 
are <strong>your own work</strong> and you may use <strong>any license</strong> 
you like.</p>
<p>Finally some examples of what is possible under the terms of the Artistic 
License: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Put yabasic on your own <strong>webpage</strong>, <strong>CD</strong> 
    or other medium, <strong>charge</strong> for the service of distibuting 
    yabasic. 
    <li>Write your own <strong>yabasic-programs</strong>, put yabasic itself 
    into the package and <strong>sell</strong> the whole thing. &quot;<strong>Sell</strong>&quot; 
    is more than charging for distribution costs and time: You may <strong>make 
    real profit</strong> with your own programs. 
    <li><strong>Modify yabasic</strong>, add or remove features and capabilities, 
    <strong>sell</strong> the modified version. 
</ul>
<p>If you are still in doubt, please check out the licenses above.</p>
