<h2><a name="ps2">Yabasic on the PS2</a></h2>
<p><b>Sony</b> has ported yabasic to the Playstation 
2 (PS2); every user of the PS2 in europe is 
now a potential user of <b>yabasic</b> !</p>
<p>However, yabasic on the PS2 is <b>different</b> from yabasic on Unix or Windows: 
Sony has added some grafic features especially for the PS2, while other features 
(printing or File I/O) remain to be implemented. Therefore not every yabasic 
program which works under Windows will work on the PS2 (and vice versa); so 
if you have problems with yabasic on the PS2 you should check sonys site <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.playstation-basic.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.playstation-basic.com/'" tppabs="http://www.playstation-basic.com/"

<h2><a name="gtkserver">Build a GTK-Gui with GTK-Server !</a></h2>
<p><b>Peter van Eerten</b> has created the&nbsp;program <b>GTK-Server</b>, which 
allows to build a decent <b>GUI</b> for any <b>yabasic</b>-Program, using the 
GTK widget set with&nbsp;<b>Listboxes</b>, <b>Radiobuttons</b>, <b>Menus</b> 
and much more.</p>
<p>The <b>GTK-Server</b> uses the well known and featureful <b>GTK-Library</b> 
(which&nbsp;is used for example to build the GUI of the <b>GIMP</b>) and communicates 
with yabasic through&nbsp;standard pipes. It is known to work with yabasic under 
Windows and Unix.</p>
<p>Peter van Eertens&nbsp;program may be used&nbsp;not only with yabasic but 
with <b>many scripting languages</b>,&nbsp;enabling them all to built their&nbsp;GUI. 
For details, descriptions and downloads, please visit:</p>
