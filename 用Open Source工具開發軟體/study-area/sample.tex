	Text for abstract: This is a demostration of what a document 
	should be. We
	don't need to care about what the document looks like, but the 
	content itself
	\end{abstract}

	\section{Introduction}
	If this is a book, it must be a book.
	\\\\
	This is the second paragrph, we try to see what's going on
	here and try to make it multiple paragraphs.
	The following is a literal text, that is, all text between
	\verb=\begin{verbatim}= and \verb=\end{verbatim}=
	will not be intepreted by TeX system
	\\\\
	This is an \emph{emphasized text}, not bad.

	\section{Real Meat}
	The following content is a demo of list and table
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	This is item 1, try to make the length of an item to a long length
	sentence, which will oversize a normal line, normally 80 chars, 
	 to see how TeX handles it.
	\item
	This is item 2
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Mathmatical Game}
	We know the math is the most beautiful language in the world,
	therefore, we need a beautiful tool to write such language.
	\LaTeX is no doubt the best one.
	\\\\
	Here is the example of math in the same text line 
	$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \int_a^b \alpha_i(x)\beta_i(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$\\
	example of math in a seperate line
	\[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \int_a^b \alpha_i(x)\beta_i(x)\;\mathrm{d}x\]
